# EFCoreMovies

# (W.I.P.)

This project is my study project from the ***Introduction to Entity Framework Core 6*** course by Felipe Gavilán on Udemy.

[Introduction to Entity Framework Core 6](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-entity-framework-core/)

I've taken this course to familiarize myself with EFcore 6 for use in my current work related project and future ones.

Felipe Gavilán teaches this course through a project in a very clear and understandable way.
He does this in a step by step process and not only explains the ***Where*** and ***What's*** but more importantly the ***WHY's***.
